Unfortunately, sliding is a common problem with reclining wheelchairs. Whenever the wheelchair reclines or returns to an upright position, the user’s back slides against the back of wheelchair, creating a shearing action. It is not only uncomfortable but may lead to skin breakdown and pressure sores.\n\nIn addition to poor positioning and less stability, sliding puts the user at risk of falling off and sustaining injuries. The innovative anti-sliding design of the MVP 502 effectively prevents the wheelchair user from sliding on the chair.",
